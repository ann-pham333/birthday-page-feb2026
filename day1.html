                &emsp;&emsp;Heyy! So we've been together for quite some time and had lots of ups and downs but no matter what happens, obviously I wouldn't want to experience life with anyone else. 
                I haven't and will never regret being with you, no matter what happens okay? Obviously all relationships will have their ups and downs but no matter how hard things get, I'll always choose you, day after day because there will never be a "better" if that "better" isn't you. 
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;I've really enjoyed the past 138 days, or so, with you. 
                And I've loved every single moment with you. 
                We've made countless amazing memories that I will forever cherish and we've went through countless more things, good and bad, but we experienced them together and that is what made every moment so special. 
                The falling asleep on video calls, all the roblox games, minecraft, introducing me to clash, the COUNTLESS calls, the late night working sessions where we just talked for half the time, video calls where you would ACTUALLY turn on your camera, our cute little pointless talks and also the deeper ones, the little fit checks, "omg I just made food and it was SOOOO delicious", all the cute little kisses, our adorable "terms of endearment" &#40;I didn't know what to call it so I had to search it up&#41;, and every single "I love you" ever.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;But anyways, I hope you like this day and I can't wait to make infinately more memories &#40;and take millions of pictures&#41; with you
            </p>

                I could've gotten more and better pictures to put here but I couldn't really find any and like my phone is GONE. So I'm sorry! <br>
