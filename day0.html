                    &emsp;Hey darling! It's going to be your 16th birthday in just a few days! Oh my goshhh! 
                    And the 16th birthday is usually pretty special you know?
                    <br>&emsp;Sooooo I basically made a like digital "advent calendar" from scratch, where you would get a whole week (7 days) of mini "gifts" before your main birthday page/gift on your birthday of courseee! (I'm not sure if they count as gifts but I thought this would be pretty cute&lt;3)<br>&emsp;Today is day 0, the starting or launch day, which starts your little adventure path that leads to your final birthday gift! Come back each day to open your next mini "gift" ;&#41;

                <p>So, for day 0, I thought we'd start things off with something small but cute and really meaningful. <br><br> I made a playlist with some songs that really spark feelings when I listen to it. In other words, songs that make me think of you and make the moments with you, and the moments I'm already thinking about you, feel 10x sweeter3 <br><br> The playlist has 16 songs that took me 2 days to handpick and then sort them! &#40;guess why theres 16 and how I sorted them&#41;<br><br>I hope you like it love&lt;3</p>
