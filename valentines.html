                            <p class="letter-p">
                                &emsp;Anyways, again, happy valentines day baby! It’s our first Valentine's together ever, and your first Valentine's ever, and my first Valentine's ever too! Omg it’s our first ever valentine’s with MANY more to comeee!

                                &emsp;We’ve been together for more than 4 months, almost 5, and these past few months have truly been the best! Every single moment, good or bad, has been my favorite cuz, well, they are with you right! Anyways, I know we’ve had our ups and downs, our happy, giggly, sweet, aweee moments and our fights too, but we’ve gone through all of that together. We’ve been together, there for each other (even if it wasn’t exactly at the right moment but we got there anyway heh) through my ups and my downs, your ups and your downs, and our ups and downs as a couple, and even though it’s been really rough at times, I wouldn’t wish for it any other way. As long as I have you, as long as we have each other, nothing matters more right♥️ We will have so many more memories to make, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

                                experiences to experience, feelings to feel, and I truly cannot wait! Whatever happens, as long as I know I have you there for me, I know I’ll be alright. Life gets reallyyyy overwhelming at times, for both of us, but I feel like we can (AND WE WILL) get through everything life puts us through together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I truly have never felt and will never feel this way for anyone else. You truly are the love of my life, okay? Everything about you is just AHHHH! And I still can’t believe you’re STILL with ME! Youre just sooo amazing and your literally the perfect guy and I just love you sooo much and I cant get enough of you and omggg! I’m sorry I’m just freaking out thinking about this that I get dumb and my writing doesnt make sense ☹️
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                <p class="list"><span>1.</span> The way your voice softens sometimes, and you talk in a more gentle sweet tone when I get upset or when you're tired or when you say goodnight and ask me for kisses or ask me to turn my camera on or when you got day 0 and you were like awww</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>2.</span> When you lowkey get rage-baited and get all cutely upset (not real upset cuz that makes me sad) and you kinda start like tweaking out >< (eg. your "airballs" when I js wasn't paying attention)</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>3.</span> The way you talk and the things you say when I get insecure and sad so you reassure me... Everything about those moments are just soooooo sweet and my favorite. Like when you talk like that and the things you say too! (I know I'm in good hands for marriage)</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>4.</span> Your sleeping position and faces when you have your cam on and I can kind of see you in the dark. YOU LOOK ADROABLE IN THOSE TIMES OKAY! And I might shine a light or something so I can see your face better heh!</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>5.</span> You in a suit (No explaination needed) or in that yellowish shirt from THAT angle (I'll show)</p>

Like that smile you make, like you're trying to deny it and pretend it doesn't matter too much to you and you "dont believe it" but that smile shows just how freaking happy the things I say make you and that smile is just ADORABLE. </p>
                                <p class="list"><span>7.</span> When I take a screenshot of you and stuff, you just like smile and shake your head and hide and it's just SOOOOO adorable! (I don't like it when you hide cuz then I can't take more pictures but it's still SOO cute like you're just soooo cute esp when u do that heh)</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>8.</span> When you give me a kiss or I compliment you or you say something real cute and then like you do this little quick nod. Like that nod like awwwwww</p>
                                <p class="list"><span>9.</span> Your stupid little laugh you do when you're like (omg idk how to describe it) but when you're like bahhh hahahaha bahhh when you're like overly laughing</p>
